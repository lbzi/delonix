USE THIS SHELL CODE TO DOWNLOAD ASSEMBLED GENOMIC DATA FROM NCBI VIA FTP.

- You will need a ftp_list file as input, giving the information of strains to fetch files from ncbi ftp:
  1. Usually can get from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/#!/overview/. 
  2. Set some filters to get the assembled items of your interest, and download tsv file (including ftp information)
  3. Open the tsv file in excel, copy the contents under the column called 'RefSeq FTP' (or perhaps 'GenBank FTP')
  4. Paste soly ftp links into 'ftp_list' file, this tile would be the input of the shell script.

- You should change TWO things before running the download_genome.sh:
  1. The path of ftp_list.
  2. The output file path you wanted.

- To download different file types from ftp, here first look at this EXAMPLE: 
  https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/001/027/105/GCF_001027105.1_ASM102710v1/
  The only difference is the suffix of these files, so change the rynsc command if you wanna change the downloaded file type.
  Here are information of some common file type information:
      ` Genomic sequence:
          - Genomic fasta file: '*[^from]_genomic.fna.gz'
      ` Annotation, features & products:
          - Genomic GenBank format: '*genomic.gbff.gz'
          - CDS from genomic fasta (DNA format): '*cds_from_genomic.fna.gz'
          - Translated CDS (aa format): '*translated_cds.faa.gz'
          - Protein fasta (aa format, protein with complete annotation, usually less seqs than translated cds): '*protein.faa.gz'
 
 -EXAMPLE:
 Take the 'download_genome.sh' as example, it downloads staphylococcus aureus genome fasta data hosted in human, as the ftp list is shown in the main file.
